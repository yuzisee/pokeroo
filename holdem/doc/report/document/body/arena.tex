\chapter{Situational Evaluation}
\label{sec:SituationalEvaluation}

When deciding on an action to take, a competent poker player must always take certain factors into account.
The combination of all of the following factors is a player's betting situation:
\begin{itemize}
\singlespacing
\item $\mathrm{Pr\{raised_x\}}$: Probability of being raised by an opponent, to $x$ chips
\item $\mathrm{Pr\{push_y\}}$: Probability of causing all opponents to fold after betting $x$ chips
\item $\mathrm{Pr\{win\}}$: Probability of winning in a showdown
\item $\mathrm{E[callers]}$: Number of opponents expected to call or raise your bet
\end{itemize}
Also considered is the probability of improving the betting situation for the next betting round, as well as best-case and worst-case $Pr_\mathrm{win}$ estimates.

The estimation of each of the above four parameters will be described in the following sections.
