\chapter{Situational Evaluation}
\label{sec:SituationalEvaluation}

When deciding on an action to take, a competent poker player must always take certain factors into account.
The combination of all of the following factors is a player's betting situation:
\begin{itemize}
\singlespacing
\item $\mathrm{Pr\{raised_x\}}$: Probability of being raised by an opponent, to $x$ chips
\item $\mathrm{Pr\{push_y\}}$: Probability of causing all opponents to fold after betting $x$ chips
\item $\mathrm{Pr\{win\}}$: Probability of winning in a showdown
\item $\mathrm{E[callers]}$: Number of opponents expected to call or raise your bet
\end{itemize}
Also considered is the probability of improving the betting situation for the next betting round, as well as best-case and worst-case $Pr_\mathrm{win}$ estimates.

The estimation of each of the above four values is accomplished using two distributions.
\begin{itemize}
\singlespacing
\item \texttt{CallStats}: The possible hands your opponent can have, compared to the hand the you have
\item \texttt{CommunityCallStats}: The possible hands any player can have, compared to each other
\end{itemize}
The \texttt{CallStats} distribution helps determine how your opponent should behave if he/she knows what hand you have.
The \texttt{CommunityCallStats} is used to measure the ''rank'' of any given hand with respect to the community cards that are available.

The following sections will explore the generation and characteristics of each of these distributions, and then describe the computation of $\mathrm{Pr\{raised_x\}, Pr\{push_x\}, Pr\{win\}, and E[callers]}.
