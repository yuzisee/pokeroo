\section{Scope}
\label{sec:Scope}

This report describes the design for a No-Limit Holdem Poker AI.
First, Section~\ref{sec:HandEvaluation} presents the architecture for a hand strength evaluation model.
Next, Section~\ref{sec:SituationalEvaluation} explores how hand strength evaluation can be leveraged to compute enough information to parametrically represent a betting situation.
Finally, Section~\ref{sec:CompleteAlgorithm} details the role of the various computed parameters and their effect on the utility functions that govern the poker bot's decisions.

\section{Purpose}
\label{sec:Purpose}

The main event of both the World Series of Poker and the World Poker Tour are multi-table no-limit holdem tournaments.
The most popular form of poker today is undoubtedly multi-player no-limit holdem.
However, the majority of current research in computer poker takes place in two-player limit holdem.
Therefore, the focus of this project is to produce a no-limit holdem poker AI that works with multiple opponents.
For simplicity, the computer poker AI being developed for this project will be restricted to ring games, rather than tournament poker.
