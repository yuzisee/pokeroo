\section{Scope}
\label{sec:Scope}

This report describes the design for a No-Limit Holdem Computer Poker AI.
First, section~\ref{sec:HandEvaluation} presents the architecture for a hand strength evaluation model.
Next, section~\ref{sec:SituationalEvaluation} explores how hand strength evaluation can be leveraged to compute enough information to parametrically represent a betting situation.
Finally, section~\ref{sec:CompleteAlgorithm} details the role of the various computed parameters and their effect on the utility functions that govern the poker bot's behaviour.

\section{Purpose}
\label{sec:Purpose}

The main event of both the World Series of Poker and the World Poker Tour are multi-table no-limit holdem tournaments.
The most popular form of poker today is undoubtedly multi-player no-limit holdem.
However, the majority of research in computer poker today currently takes place in two-player limit holdem.
Therefore, the focus of this project is to produce a no-limit holdem poker AI that scales to several opponents.
For simplicity, the computer poker AI being developed for this project will be restricted to the for ring games, rather than tournaments.
