\chapter{Complete Algorithm}
\label{sec:CompleteAlgorithm}

Once the fundamental situational evaluation functions are established, they can be combined to produce a complete betting algorithm.
The core ``poker bot'' is implemented through the following code path:
\begin{itemize}
\singlespacing
\item \texttt{PositionalStrategy::StoreDealtHand(const CommunityPlus \& o)}

Calling this method assigns a new hand to a bot/player.
Bots will later call \texttt{ViewDealtHand()} to access their current hand.

\item \texttt{PositionalStrategy::SeeCommunity(const Hand\& h, const int8 cardsInCommunity)}

Calling this method informs the bot that the next betting round is about to begin.
It will now have all the information that it needs in order to begin histogram generation.
Histogram generation requires a significant portion of runtime; by generating the histograms ahead of time, less computation will required when the bot's turn to bet begins.
Furthermore, a bot may need to bet multiple times in a betting round, but since the community cards won't change in the middle of a betting round, there is no need to recompute any of the histograms until the next betting round is about to begin.

\item \texttt{ImproveGainStrategy::MakeBet()} and \texttt{float64 DeterredGainStrategy::MakeBet()}

Calling the \texttt{MakeBet()} function initiates the poker bot's search for the optimal bet in the current situation.
When the function completes, it returns the optimal bet size as determined by the poker bot.

\end{itemize}
