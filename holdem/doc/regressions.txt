Results:
ro-643 MATCHES rw-643: Reproducible over IDE and working copy
rw-643 differs rw-644: Attempts to implement NumberAtFirstAction
  ** We can manually retract the calls to NumberAtFirstAction() and should be able to reproduce rw-643 again.
   --> rw-644-repro
    ** bugfix1.diff <== roundPlayers := playersInHand // at the start of each betting round (rather than livePlayers) 
   --> rw-644-retract

  [OK!]
   ro-643-bugfix1 MATCHES rw-644-retract

rw-644 differs rw-647: New implementation of firstActionRoundPlayers
  ** If we have retracted calls to NumberAtFirstAction() we should be able to reconcile this.
   --> rw-647-retract

  [OK!]
   rw-644-retract MATCHES rw-647-retract
   (log format changes, but behaviour same)

rw-647 differs rw-648: An actual change to riskprice and foldprice that excludes a BB check.
  ** We can backport this revision into our testing.

   --> rw-648-retract
   --> ro-643-patch2 <== includes:
                         [] bugfix1.diff
                         [] backport of r648

  [OK!]
   ro-643-patch2 matches rw-648-retract

rw-648 MATCHES rw-653: Mostly inconsequential tweaks
rw-653 differs rw-671: Large refactor including new implementations of NumberAtFirstActionOfRound
  ** If we have retracted calls to NumberAtFirstActionOfRound() we should be able to reconcile this.
  ** handsToBeat() is NumberInHand() -- Is that what we always want?

  ** NOTE: rw-657 changed statHybridR from best(statranking, statrelation) to worst(statranking, statrelation)
  ** NOTE: rw-654 has a bug in f_battle

   --> ro-643-patch3 <== includes:
                          [] bugfix1.diff
                          [] backport of r648 (patch2)
                          [] switch hybridMagnified (patch3)

   --> rw-671-retract2 <== includes:
                           [] Replace NumberAtFirstAction() with NumberStartedRoundInclAllin()
                           [] retract2.diff and comment out assertion in GainModel::combineStatResults (functionmodel.cpp)

   --> rw-671-retract3 <== includes: retract2+
                           [] ACTUAL BUGFIX

  [OK...]
   ro-643-patch3 ALMOST matches rw-671-retract3b
    (differ in fullVersus)

   --> rw-671-retract4 <== includes: retract3c+
                           [] fullVersus is in the correct units (opponent count vs. player count)

   --> ro-643-patch4 <== includes:
                          [] bugfix1.diff
                          [] backport of r648 (patch2)
                          [] switch hybridMagnified (patch3)
                          [] disable eFolds ASSUMEFOLDS for now.

  [OK!]
   ro-643-patch4 matches rw-671-retract4 up to rounding error in trisectionStep

===== We did retract3 wrong. With the actual bugfix 

rw-671 matches rw-677 excluding differences from rw-674 to re-675
rw-673 MATCHES rw-674: Comments only.
rw-674 differs rw-675: Just slightly, one hand plays just a bit different. ??
rw-675 MATCHES rw-676: Audit only, no code changes
rw-676 differs rw-677: Rounding difference???
rw-677 MATCHES rw-679: Should be comments only (and changes already backported)

===== Summary of notable tunables
 * hybridMagnified worst vs. best
 * handsToBeat() numberInHand vs. numberStartedRound

===== Summary of audit tunables
 * f_battle [high priority, yet it was already recently fixed to be number started round down from hands dealt]
 * ExpectedCallD and ExactCallD: opponent [med priority, it could be fine as-is]


===== Summary of notable confusions
 * ro-643 has a bug in roundPlayers
 * rw-654 has two bugs in GainModel
 ** uninitialized f_battle and e_battle (which are used elsewhere)
 ** invalid input assumption in cleangeomeanpow about .repeated
