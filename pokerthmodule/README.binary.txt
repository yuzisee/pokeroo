To run PokerTH 0.7.1 Win32 and use holdemDLL.dll as the AI engine for local games:
	1. Make sure you have installed PokerTH 0.7.1
	2. Copy the included pokerth.exe into your PokerTH installation directory (overwriting the existing one)
	3. Copy holdemdb.ini and holdemdll.dll into the PokerTH installation directory.
	4. Copy the data directory into the PokerTH installation direction (we are adding data/ai's holdemC and holdemW files to PokerTH)
	5. Start PokerTH
	NOTE: The game will run a little slower due to increased processing demands (I prefer gamespeed 9 or 10)
